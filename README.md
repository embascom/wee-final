#The Olympic Games
The Olympic Games are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympics are held every four years with the summer and winter games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympics Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD.
